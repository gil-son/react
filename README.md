## What's React?

<p> 
 React is the most popular JavaScript library and is used to build a user interface (UI). It provides an excellent response for the user to add commands using a new method of rendering websites.

The components of this tool were developed by Facebook. It was released in 2013 as an open source JavaScript tool. Currently, it remains ahead of its main competitors, such as Angular and Bootstrap, the two best-selling JavaScript libraries.
